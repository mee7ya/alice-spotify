# alice-spotify

**Disclaimer**: It does not allow Alice speaker to playback songs from Spotify, because they are DRM protected.

It allows to use [Alice](https://yandex.ru/alice) to control the playback of your Spotify account by implementing 
[Dialogs Skill](https://dialogs.yandex.ru/).

Currently, it's for my own personal use and the project is WIP

## Prerequisites
* [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Spotify App](https://developer.spotify.com/)
* [Dialogs Skill](https://dialogs.yandex.ru/)

## Features
* Recognizes what song is currently playing
* Searches for a song and switches to it

## Issues
Dialogs Skill gets timed out if not used for a certain period of time. 
Definitely messes up with QoL. Don't know a way around it
